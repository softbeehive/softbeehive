2014 was a super dynamic year for me. I traveled to Redwood City, CA, to experience Silicon Valley first hand.

As a member of Identity team, I worked closely with designers building pixel-perfect responsive UI. I wrote a structured backbone code and practiced TDD in Rails.

The team was exceptional! We even had a war room! One weekend I cycled to Sausalito and ðŸŒ² Muir Woods ðŸŒ²
