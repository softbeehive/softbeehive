Starting a company is an experience unlike any other. Although it's an ongoing project, we've already lived through a kaleidoscope of emotions.

Valisa is made to solve an authentic problem. People should be able to plan their travel in minutes, not hours.

We believe in hard work and dedication. One day valisa will be the best travel assistant in the world.
