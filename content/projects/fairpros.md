I just started working at Svitla Systems. It was ground zero of my git story.

My responsibilities included: creating a new Drupal template, applying company visual style, plus cross-browser compatibility. But I also helped to customize CMS modules, wrote hooks, tested forms.

During that period, I got a clear understanding of planning importance and recognized how crucial is team communication.
