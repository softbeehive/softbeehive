I led efforts to transition codebase from legacy Angular to the latest Vue in a cross-functional team. We managed to rewrite (and improve) the whole system piece by piece without taking it down.

I interviewed candidates, mentored, and on-boarded new team members. Furthermore, I represented car2go at tech events in Berlin & Amsterdam.

Summary: it's one of the greatest companies I worked for.
