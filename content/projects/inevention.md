When I started with InEvention, it was under a heavy refactoring. In just a few months, I completely rebuilt UI and optimized user experience on desktop and mobile.

My project tech lead said: "Oleksandr was instrumental to pack a lot of information into a UI that had to be consistent and intuitive."

It even worked in IE8.
