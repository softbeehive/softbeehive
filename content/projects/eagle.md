EagleManager had a very intense work pace with a super strict deadline (Scrum). Each team member was tested to the limit.

I worked closely with designers and was responsible for map integration and charts. I mastered new techniques of packing plenty of data into limited space.

Our team delivered a 100% finished project on time.
