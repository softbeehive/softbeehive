It was a technical challenge at EF. In 2014 I wanted to commemorate fallen sailors of WWI.

Flickr Ocean Trawler dedicated to British naval trawlers and their crew sweeping the sea for mines. I created drawings using Intuos 5 pen tablet.

SPA passes a query - backend gets results from Flickr API - results processed and saved in MySQL - backend renders a view - SPA gets HTML partial and adds it to DOM.
