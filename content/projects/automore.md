When designing Automore, my approach was to connect the automotive topic with respective archetypes.

Its logo resembles a vintage steering wheel, while the manual gearbox banner plays its emphasizing role.

Search form outline designed to attract visitor's attention. The light blue frame around the container eases a high contrast effect near viewport edges.
