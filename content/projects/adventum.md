I created a new version of the corporate website for a longtime customer. In dialogue with the client, I picked a color scheme, branding, fonts, stock photographs. 

Due to the explosive growth of Android & iOS, responsive mobile-first layout was the best choice.

Simple architecture and modern tools are a solid basis for a swift, minimalistic, up-to-date website. It ran on Ubuntu Server at DigitalOcean.
