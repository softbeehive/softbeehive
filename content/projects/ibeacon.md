I worked in a small feature-team building beacon management platform using Angular. It provided me with an excellent chance to learn about Bluetooth and iBeacon protocol.

I followed DRY principle, significantly improving the project's health, documented features, practiced continuous deployment.

In tandem with my colleague, I created and maintained a compact end-to-end testing framework based on Protractor.
