### From idea to production

The story of softbeehive began back in 2008 while I was studying mechanical engineering at National Aviation University in Kyiv, Ukraine. At the age of 19, I became disillusioned about my university and got bored by the slow learning process.

I always wanted to jump straight into solving practical, real-world issues, but felt there was a little room for creativity. The jet engine in the lecture hall, I was so captivated by a year earlier, seemed like a museum exhibit.

Inspired by successful internet projects of that period, I decided to found a web studio. A few weeks later, I completed the first commercial project earning $100. That joy of reaching the goal shines in my collection of memories ever since.

### Work philosophy

*Over <experience-counter></experience-counter> years*, I built many web apps. Society transformed, new tools and techniques evolved, javascript gained popularity, but web browser is still a central app on our devices. And yet, due to the web's decentralized nature, frontend devs have to deal with so many caveats.

Modern, responsive, performant, accessible web app is a synonym to "competitive edge." It doesn't matter which religion you practice: agile or lean. People's values, knowledge, and working culture define the fate of the business. The ability to focus on achieving the primary goal is what sets efficient teams apart.

### Summary
At work, I care about the look and feel, speed, security, accessibility, and ethics of the project. I love the role at the intersection of software engineering and graphic design. This portfolio is a compressed snapshot of my personal and professional evolution.
