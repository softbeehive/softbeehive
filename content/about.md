### From idea to production

The story of softbeehive began back in 2008 when I picked my internet nickname while studying mechanical engineering at National Aviation University in Kyiv, Ukraine. At the age of 19 I became disillusioned about my university and got bored by the slow learning process.

I always wanted to jump straight into solving practical real-world issues, but I felt there was a little room for creativity. Jet engine in lecture hall, I was so capivated by a year earlier, seemed like a museum exhibit. One beautiful day I came to realize I can't wait any longer.

Starting a web studio seemed like a bright idea. Inspired by successful internet projects of that time, I wanted to be one of them. The joy of earning my first $100 by building a website can't be expressed in writing, it was utter happiness.

### Work philosophy

In the course of 12 years I built many web apps. Tools changed, new techniques developed, flash died, society transformed, but browser is still a central app on our devices. 

Simple things are not trivial. Due to the decentralized nature of the web, developers have to deal with so many caveats. Scrum, kanban, cross-functional, feature-teams or even cowboy coding: setup is less significant than culture. Ability to focus on achieving the primary goal is what sets healthy teams apart.

### Motivation

I love my role at the intersection of software engineering and graphic design. This portfolio is a compressed snapshot of my personal and  professional evolution. Let me know about your experience if my story sounds familiar to you.
