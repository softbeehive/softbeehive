### From idea to production

The story of softbeehive began back in 2008 while I was studying mechanical engineering at National Aviation University in Kyiv. At the age of 19 I became disillusioned about my university and got bored by the slow learning process.

I always wanted to jump straight into solving practical real-world issues, but I felt there was a little room for creativity. Jet engine in the lecture hall, I was so capivated by a year earlier, seemed like a museum exhibit.

Inspired by successful internet projects of that time, I decided to found a web studio. Few weeks later I completed first commercial project earning $100. That joy of reaching the goal shines in my collection of memories ever since.

### Work philosophy

In the course of *<experience-counter></experience-counter> years* I built many web apps. Society transformed, new tools and techniques evolved, flash died, but web browser is still a central app on our devices. And still due to the decentralized nature of the web, frontend devs have to deal with so many caveats.

Modern responsive performant accessible website is a synonym to competitive edge. It doesn't matter which religion you practice: agile or lean. People values, their knowledge and working culture define the fate of business. Ability to focus on achieving the primary goal is what sets efficient teams apart.

### Summary
At work I care about look and feel, speed, security, accessibility and ethics of the project. I love the role at the intersection of software engineering and graphic design. This portfolio is a compressed snapshot of my personal and professional evolution.
